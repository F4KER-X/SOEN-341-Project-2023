How to run react in vscode

1) make sure you have installed Node JS
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) To start the react app, run npm start (make sure u run this in the talentvault folder)


The react app is called talentvault, inside that folder you will find lots of goodies

you DO NOT have to touch:
1) the node_modules folder
2) any of the package.json files
3) the .gitignore

The readme contains relevant info about the commands you can run, but
you can always just type npm help in the console and itll show u the available commands


The work we will do will be in the src folder
