1) make sure you have installed Node JS
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) To start the react app, run npm start (make sure u run this in the talentvault folder)

3) if you want, you can download this extension for react on vscode :

The react app is called talentvault, inside that folder you will find lots of goodies
you DO NOT have to touch:
1) the node_modules folder
2) any of the package.json files (only on rly rare occasions)
3) the .gitignore

The readme contains relevant info about the commands you can run, but
you can always just type npm help in the console and itll show u the available commands


The work we will do will be in the src folder
I have created a folder called pages- this is where the main pages will be (about, login, register, dashboard)

ABOUT- first page of the website, info about our website and services --> the home page basically
LOGIN- the login page
REGISTER- the sign up page
DASHBOARD- the pages w all job postings, can only be accessed once logged into account 

I have created a folder called components- this is where the COMMON COMPONENTS will be
things like headers, footers, icons.... etc. anything that will/should be reused on multiple pages


*****Most of the comments i have left in the code will be deleted once were more familiar with react,
i just left them kind of as a guide so you can understand the code as we are learning it


THINGS TO NOTE!!!!
take a look at Ali's Figma designs (on our discord front end chat), to have an idea of what our pages should looklike

our accent color is a purple/blue by the code : #4540DB
our font is Roboto ( i have imported this using a link in the index.html file in the public folder)


Things i have installed
npm install bootstrap

npm install react-router-dom
(for the routing)

npm install react-icons
all different icons that are available for use, check this website to see whats available
